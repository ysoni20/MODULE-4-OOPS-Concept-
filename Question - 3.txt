Que - 3: What is the difference between OOP and POP?

Ans : OOP:

-> Object oriented
-> Program is divided into objects.
-> Bottom-up approach.
-> Inheritance property is used.
-> It uses access specifier.
-> Encapsulation is used to hide the data.
-> Concept of virtual function.
-> use for solving big problems.

            POP:

-> Structure oriented.
-> Program is divided into functions.
-> Top-down approach.
-> Inheritance is not allowed.
-> It doesnâ€™t use access specifier.
-> No data hiding.
-> No virtual function.
-> Not suitable for solving big problems.
